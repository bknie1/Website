# Website

This is my personal portfolio website (www.bknieriem.com). I'm just exercising my front end capabilities so it may change on a whim!

## Tech
- jQuery
- Font Awesome
- Bulma
- Sass
- Google's Content Security Policy

## Successes
- Bulma and Sass were both new to me at the start of this personal website project.
- I accidentally forced myself into adhering to Google's Content Security Policy following some user error; I have a Chrome extension that only allows whitelisted Javascript to run in my browser. I forgot to allow my own website but had mistaken it for a security issue on my end. I took some time to update my meta tags to whitelist safe files, mitigate cross site scripting attempts, and adhere to Google's Content Security Policy; something I expect will be mainstream in the future.
